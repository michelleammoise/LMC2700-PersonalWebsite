            <h2><u>LMC 2700 Assignment 5: Ramblin' Romance</u></h2>
            <p> Ramblin’ Romance is a Georgia Tech-themed dating simulation game or a visual novel in which the player
                is on a mission to land a date to a party Friday night. The player is allowed to input their name and
                select which major they want to be, which uniquely assigns the player statistical
                values for intellect, charisma (a.k.a “rizz”), and attractiveness. The three potential love interests
                (male: Chad, female: Olivia, and non-binary: Jordan) are assigned their own statistics in which the
                player wants to accumulate a high enough skill level to be deemed as “compatible” with their interest so
                that they can receive the “good” ending. The game, narrated by Buzz, spans a four-day time span where
                each day the players are given important choices that heavily impact the player’s potential to receive
                the “good”, “neutral” or “bad” endings. </p>
            <p><u>Future Potential Updates:</u>
                <li>Implementing player/love interest customization</li>
                <li>Adding smoother cutscenes and transitions</li>
                <li>Incorporating sound effects/music</li>
                <li>Adding voice actors</li>
            </p>
